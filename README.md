# COMP0034: Coursework 1 repository

For each chart, write a markdown file (e.g. comp0034_cw1.md or in the README.md) text to:
1.	State the target audience and the question that the visualisation is intended to address.
2.	Explain your design for each visualisation. You can do this before you code the visualisation. 
3.	Optionally, a stronger response to this aspect will also evaluate the resulting visualisation with respect to its design. You will only be able to do this once you have created the visualisation in your dashboard.
There is no word limit for the explanation. As a guide, 200 words per visualisation is likely to be sufficient to explain the design.

You do not need to provide a sketch or representation of the design, you only need to explain how you designed the visualisation that you will subsequently code in your app. For each visualisation that you design consider:
•	The target audience for this visualisation. Consider using the relevant persona (or other format) from COMP0035.
•	The question that this visualisation is intended to answer. Use the questions you identified in COMP0035, or you can write new questions.
•	The data needed from your data set to answer the question
•	The type of chart (e.g. pie, bar etc) and its appropriateness for the question/audience. Use the resources given in the teaching materials.
•	The visual aspects of the design (e.g. style, colours, titles). Use the literature and resources introduced in the teaching materials; or other relevant sources from your independent literature research.
[Optional] Evaluate each visualisation. You will only be able to do this step once you have coded the application and can evaluate the chart.
1.	How well does the visualisation you created meet with the design choices you made?
2.	What are the strengths and weaknesses of the design with respect to the target audience and the question you were intending to answer?
3.	If relevant, suggest any ways in which your visualisation design could be improved.
